                The NHS is projected to face a significant workforce gap by 2037. With international medical graduates (IMGs) forming a substantial share of the medical workforce, consistent, high-quality onboarding is essential. NextDoc Global is a governance-first, AI-enabled platform that supports four critical steps in the IMG journey: CV shortlisting, interview preparation, sponsorship support, and role alignment. The approach follows published guidance (e.g., Topol Review, NHS Long Term Workforce Plan, GMC pathways) and is designed to augment, not replace, human decision-making. Early simulations, while limited, suggest potential improvements in time-to-onboard and candidate experience. A phased rollout from Q4-2025 will begin with pilots, predefined metrics (e.g., time-to-shortlist, candidate feedback), and transparent reporting. Our aim is practical: help NHS teams and candidates navigate processes more clearly, more fairly, and with measurable outcomes.
